Say it is a forum where anyone can talk to anyone about anything.
Authentification system (Log in, Log out, Register) with encryption of passwords

Post system, users can post, like, share on their page content that other user created

Moderation system, users can report content to moderators who can then take action if need be

About us page, User profile page, Homepage with multiple post display

Comment system, user can comment others post

Yet to be implemented:
{
Notification system, users are notified when someone likes/share/comment their post 

HTTPS, Encryption of trafic

Authentification is also available with Github and Google
}

It uses HTML,CSS,GO for the backend and JS in a healthy proportion.
SQLite is also used as the project database.
